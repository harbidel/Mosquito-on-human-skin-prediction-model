# Mosquito on human skin prediction model
Bulding a simple CNN multi image classifier model to predict the presence of mosquito on human skin using transfer Learning (VGG16).

VGG16 is object detection and classification algorithm which is able to classify 1000 images of 1000 different categories with 92.7% accuracy. It is one of the popular algorithms for image classification and is easy to use with transfer learning.

# Description
A mosquito images dataset that suitable for training and evaluating a recognition systems for the mosquito on human skin. Images of mosquito were obtained from a WHO accredited breeding laboratory, therefore validated the process of data annotation. There are three species of mosquitoes (Aedes aegypti,  Aedes albopictus, Culex quinquefasciatus) in two conditions (normal landing and smashed from). Therefore, six classes of the images were obtained from the dataset construction.
