Predicting the presence of mosquito on human skin using machine learning model
# Description
A mosquito images dataset that suitable for training and evaluating a recognition systems for the mosquito on human skin. Images of mosquito were obtained from a WHO accredited breeding laboratory, therefore validated the process of data annotation. There are three species of mosquitoes (Aedes aegypti,  Aedes albopictus, Culex quinquefasciatus) in two conditions (normal landing and smashed from).
